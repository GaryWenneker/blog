<p>And for the Nth time I went to the servicedesk to reinstall everything on my machine. Why? Too much stuff on it, getting slow, C-drive just notified that my drive was full. Do you recognize it?</p><p>So you think your laptop is fast? Then take in account that by default your laptop will be running Â in this state.</p><h3 id="energy-power-plan-that-s-tricking-you-that-it-s-all-ok-but-it-s-not-">Energy Power Plan that's tricking you that it's all ok, but it's not!</h3><p><br>This seams like it means that it streamlines the performance in general.

Navigate to your Control Panel, click Power Options on the left, and again select 'Create a power plan'.

This means that your laptop will use its full capacity and allow you to go Black Alert ;-)</p><figure class="kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="/content/images/2019/04/giphy-1-.gif" class="kg-image"></figure>
